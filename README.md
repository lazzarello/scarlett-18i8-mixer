# scarlett-18i8-mixer

This is an ALSA mixer UI for the Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 USB audio interface. It requires [AlsaJsonGateway](https://github.com/fulup-bzh/AlsaJsonGateway) which needs to run along side the server to send commands to the host OS. Pull requests accepted for security fixes.

* The UI framework is [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* The audio control elements are [NexusUI](https://nexus-js.github.io/ui/)
